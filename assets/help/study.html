		<h1>Study screen</h1>
		<p>
		This screen is definitely the most important one in the app. Here
		the learning process takes place :)
		</p>
		<p>
		In the upper part of the screen you can see flags of both languages 
		(target language on top, base language under it). To the right of these
		there's a progress bar representing the progress of the current session, with
		the number of questions answered correctly and number of total questions in
		this session under it. You can also see the elapsed and estimated total time
		of the session.
		</p>
		<p>
		In the upper right corner is located the <b>audio button</b>. If activated
		the application will read both the question and answer at the appropriate
		time. When this button is activated you can also use <b>gestures</b> to indicate
		whether you knew the answer or not instead of the buttons. Moving your finger
		up on the touchscreen will have the same effect as the '<b>Correct</b>' button.
		Moving it down will have the same effect as the '<b>Incorrect</b>' button.
		This combination of audio and gestures lets you learn new words without
		even looking at the screen! It means you can do it with headphones on and
		your phone in your pocket. <a href="tts.html">Read more about Langleo's
		Text-To-Speech capabilities</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
		On the bottom of the screen there are always two buttons. When new word
		is introduced they are '<b>I know it already</b>' and '<b>Continue</b>'. The second
		one shows the next word. The first one
		also shows the next word, but doesn't count the current word as new, so Langleo
		will actually show one more new word. If the shown word is not new then
		the two buttons are '<b>Incorrect</b>' and '<b>Correct</b>'. Use them to indicate
		whether you knew the answer or not.
		</p>
		<p>
		If you feel like learning more new words today than the current limit
		then you can increase it in '<b>Menu->More new words</b>'.
		</p>
		<p>
		You can also quickly delete or edit the word you're seeing now by accessing
		these options after pressing 'Menu' button.
