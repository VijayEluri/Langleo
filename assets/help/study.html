		<h1>Study screen</h1>
		<p>
		<a href="tts.html">Click here if you have problems with Text-To-Speech feature</a>
		</p>
		<p>
		This screen is definitely the most important one in the app.
		The learning process takes place here :)
		</p>
		<p>
		In the upper part of the screen you can see flags of both languages 
		(target language on top, base language under it). To the right of these
		there's a progress bar representing the progress of the current session, with
		the number of questions answered correctly and number of total questions in
		this session under it. You can also see the elapsed and estimated total time
		of the session.
		</p>
		<p>
		In the upper right corner is located the <b>audio button</b>. When activated
		the application will read aloud both the question and the answer at the appropriate
		time. When this button is activated <b>gestures</b> can be used to indicate
		whether you know the answer or not instead of the buttons. Moving your finger
		up on the touchscreen will have the same effect as the '<b>Correct</b>' button.
		Moving it down will have the same effect as the '<b>Incorrect</b>' button.
		This combination of audio and gestures lets you learn new words without
		even looking at the screen! It means you can do it with headphones on and
		your phone in your pocket. <a href="tts.html">Read more about Langleo's
		Text-To-Speech capabilities</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
		On the bottom of the screen are located control buttons. Usually there are two.
		The 'green tick' means you knew the correct translation of a given word, the 
		'red cross' means you didn't. When a new word is introduced there is only
		one button.
		</p>
		<p>
		If you feel like learning more new words today than the current limit
		then you can increase it in '<b>Menu->More new words</b>'.
		</p>
		<p>
		You can also quickly delete or edit the word you're seeing now by accessing
		these options after pressing 'Menu' button.
