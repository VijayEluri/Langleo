		<h1>Langleo</h1>
		<p>
		Hi! Welcome to Langleo :) Langleo lets you learn vocabulary really
		efficiently by trying to predict when you'll forget the given word
		and asking you about just before it happens. First few introductory
		sections of	this help page explain basic ideas behind Langleo and
		tell you how to use it efficiently. Other sections describe all
		the screens in this application.
		</p>
		<p>
		Remember that at any time when using Langleo you can press
		the 'Menu' button and then 'Help' to get information about the screen
		you're currently in.

		<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
		<p>
		Langleo uses an approach similar to the Supermemo method. It means it will
		try to predict when you'll forget a word and will ask you about it just
		before it happens. 
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>Langleo's main goals are effectiveness and efficiency.</b> I've personally learned 1200
		new spanish words during the first 30 days of using it (40 words per day
		on average) and I believe it's possible to learn 80 words per day.
		That means you could learn 5000 words (usually enough to be able to
		communicate	in a given language freely) in 2-3 months. I don't think
		any other tool available for the Android platform can help you
		achieve such results.
		</p>
		<p>
		A certain number of new words is introduced daily (can be changed in
		preferences). Langleo will ask you about them later depending on your
		general performance and calculated difficulty of the word. 
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>Words are organized into lists and lists into collections.</b> 
		So for example you can have a collection named 'French' and inside of it
		few lists like 'Weather', 'Colors', 'Body parts' etc. Collections hold
		informations like base and target languages, collection's priority and name.
		</p>
		<h3>Studying</h3>
		<p>
		When you're studying a word will be show to you. Read it and 
		decide whether you know it or not. Click somewhere on the screen to see
		the correct answer. If you remembered it correctly then click '<b>Correct</b>',
		otherwise click '<b>Incorrect</b>'.
		</p>
		<p>
		When Langleo introduces a new word it shows a '<b>New word</b>' label on top
		of the study screen. Try to memorize it and click '<b>Continue</b>'. If you knew
		the word previously then click '<b>I know it already</b>'. This will indicate
		that you knew this word already and Langleo will show one more new word
		instead if this one.
		</p>
		<h2><a name="usage">Using Langleo efficiently</a></h2>
		<p>
		First, absolutely necessary thing for efficient learning is your
		decision to improve your level of foreign language skills.
		Learning vocabulary is a long process, which requires quite a lot of
		commitment and motivation. So before actually starting to learn make
		sure that you're motivated enough to keep learning at least for few weeks.
		If you'll get bored after few days then the entire process will turn
		out to be just a waste of your time.
		</p>
		<p>
		Langleo should be used at least once, and preferably 2-3 times a day.
		Always answer all the questions in the current session. If you're constantly
		unable to do so then try decreasing the number of new words learned daily
		in the preferences window. If you think you could learn more words today
		then you can always add more new words for this single day in the Study
		window (Menu->More new words).
		</p>
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>Make sure all the words you learn are fully understandable. If you have
		problems remembering a certain word then it may be a good idea
		to reformulate it</li>
		<li>When studying make sure that after seeing the correct answer
		you spend few seconds repeating it in your head. Seeing the answer
		alone has little or no effect.</li>
		<li>For every word try to write (or find) a sentence which uses it and put it
		in the word's '<b>Note</b>' field. This sentence will then be shown during
		studying. It tremendously improves learning time and shows you a real
		life example.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2><a name="import_guide">Importing and exporting words</a></h2>
		<p>
		Langleo lets you import and export words from/to text files.
		This is especially useful when you want to learn words obtained from
		other source, for example a web site or you just prefer
		to create lists of words on your computer instead of your phone.
		Each text file will be imported as a separate list with the same name
		as the file.
		</p>
		<h3>Format of text files</h3>
		<p>
		Imported text files should contain one word per line with the original
		word, its translation and note associated with it (in that order) separated by one
		character (or string), preferably a tab. Notes are not mandatory, so
		it's perfectly OK if a line contains just the word and its translation.
		Lines with a format different that that will be ignored.
		</p>
		<h3>Importing files</h3>
		<p>
		Let's say that you have created few text files on your computer and
		you'd like to import them to Langleo. First you have to copy them
		on your SD card into the Langleo directory (you can of course create
		a deeper directory structure in there). Then in the app go to 
		'<b>Collections</b>' and there select or create a collection to which you'd like
		to import the files. Click on the collection and then press 'Menu->Import'.
		On the following screen select the files and click 'OK'. Later you can
		change the import options if needed - make sure everything under
		'<b>Will be imported as</b>' looks right. After you click 'Import' the import
		process starts.
		Langleo is able to import approximately 20 words per second so it
		can take some time depending on the size of your files, although it
		shouldn't be an issue at all because the entire process takes place
		in the background.
		</p>
		<h3>Exporting files</h3>
		<p>
		If you want to export words from your collection then click 
		'Collections'. Then click on the selected collection and press
		'Menu->Export'. On the following screen you can select lists which will
		be exported. After you click 'Export' the files should appear on your
		SD card in the Langleo/&lt;name of collection&gt; directory.
		</p>
		<h2><a name="study">Study screen</a></h2>
		<p>
		This screen is definitely the most important one in the app. Here
		the learning process takes place :)
		</p>
		<p>
		In the upper part of the screen you can see flags of both languages 
		(target language on top, base language under it). To the right of these
		there's a progress bar representing the progress of the current session, with
		the number of questions answered correctly and number of total questions in
		this session under it. You can also see the elapsed and estimated total time
		of the session.
		</p>
		<p>
		In the upper right corner is located the <b>audio button</b>. If activated
		the application will read both the question and answer at the appropriate
		time. When this button is activated you can also use <b>gestures</b> to indicate
		whether you knew the answer or not instead of the buttons. Moving your finger
		up on the touchscreen will have the same effect as the '<b>Correct</b>' button.
		Moving it down will have the same effect as the '<b>Incorrect</b>' button.
		This combination of audio and gestures lets you learn new words without
		even looking at the screen! It means you can do it with headphones on and
		your phone in your pocket. Read more about Langleo's Text-To-Speech capabilities
		in the section below.
		</p>
		<p>
		On the bottom of the screen there are always two buttons. When new word
		is introduced they are '<b>I know it already</b>' and '<b>Continue</b>'. The second
		one shows the next word. The first one
		also shows the next word, but doesn't count the current word as new, so Langleo
		will actually show one more new word. If the shown word is not new then
		the two buttons are '<b>Incorrect</b>' and '<b>Correct</b>'. Use them to indicate
		whether you knew the answer or not.
		</p>
		<p>
		If you feel like learning more new words today than the current limit
		then you can increase it in '<b>Menu->More new words</b>'.
		</p>
		<p>
		You can also quickly delete or edit the word you're seeing now by accessing
		these options after pressing 'Menu' button.
		</p>
		<h3><a name="tts">Text-To-Speech</a></h3>
		<p>
		Please note that Langleo currently uses Text-To-Speech library
		to convert text to audio. Its current version is far from perfect, but
		the quality is going to improve in the next version of Android.
		It also doesn't read properly certain characters, especially the ones
		with accents above them.
		</p>
		<p>
		</p>
		<h2><a name="collections">Collections screen</a></h2>
		<p>
		This screen lists all the collections you currently have. Each item
		in the list contains it's name, flags of languages, overall statistics and
		progress information. If a collection is disabled only it's name and flags
		of used languages are shown.
		</p>
		<p>To see contents of a collection simply click on it. To create a new collection press 'Menu->New'.
		Click and hold on a collection to edit or delete it.
		</p>
		<h2><a name="edit_collection">Edit collection screen</a></h2>
		<p>
		This screen lets you edit the selected collection. You can change it's name,
		base and target languages and priority. Priority controls the number of
		new words that will be taken from this collection, higher means more new words
		will come from this collection.
		</p>
		<p>
		You can also disable this collection. This means no new words will come
		from this collection.
		</p>
		<h2><a name="lists">Lists screen</a></h2>
		<p>
		This screen shows all lists in a given collection. You can add a new list
		by pressing '<b>Menu->New list</b>'. You can also download lists from internet
		by clicking '<b>Menu->Download</b>' or import them from text files ('<b>Menu->Import</b>').
		Exporting lets you save the words from selected lists in text
		files on your SD card.
		</p>
		<h2><a name="edit_list">Edit list screen</a></h2>
		<p>
		This just lets you change the name of the list.
		</p>
		<h2><a name="words">Words screen</a></h2>
		<p>
		Lists words in current list, the first line contains the word and the
		second its translation. Click on the word to edit it. 
		</p>
		<h2><a name="edit_word">Edit word screen</a></h2>
		<p>
		Here you can change the word, its translation and the note attached to it 
		(note is shown under the translation when studying). Clicking 'New' saves
		current word and creates a new one.
		</p>
		<h2><a name="select_file">File selection screen</a></h2>
		<p>
		This screen lets you select files which you want to import.
		Remember that each file will be loaded as a separate list and all
		selected files must use the same character as field separator.
		</p>
		<h2><a name="import">Import screen</a></h2>
		<p>
		On this screen you can change options necessary for proper importing
		of the selected files (read <a href="#import_guide">Importing and exporting files</a>
		section first). On the bottom of the screen you can see an example of
		a line taken from the selected files. Under it you can see how it will
		be interpreted. Change field separator and switch word/translation
		order if necessary. 
		</p>
		<h2><a name="select_list">List selection screen</a></h2>
		<p>
		Here you can select lists from your collection which you'd like to export.
		Selected lists will be saved on your SD card in Langleo/&lt;name of collection&gt;
		directory.
		</p>
		<h2><a name="download">Download screen</a></h2>
		<p>
		This screen shows the available lists which can be downloaded for target
		language of current collection. The lists are downloaded directly from
		studystack.com so active internet connection is required. Click on the
		list you'd like to download to your collection.
		Use the search box on the top for quicker navigation.
		</p>
		<p>
		Langleo updates this list every few days, if for some reason you want
		to force an update then use 'Menu->Refresh'.
		</p>
		<h2><a name="list_details">List details screen</a></h2>
		<p>
		Here you can see the contents if the selected list before downloading it.
		Make sure that labels above columns match the languages in the actual content.
		If they don't then use the '<b>Switch word/translation order</b>' box.
