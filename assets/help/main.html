		<h1>Langleo</h1>
		<p>
		Hi! Welcome to Langleo :) Langleo lets you learn vocabulary really
		efficiently by trying to predict when you'll forget the given word
		and asking you about just before it happens. The introductory section of
		this help page explains basic ideas behind Langleo and tells you how
		to use it efficiently. Other sections describe all screens in the
		application.
		</p>
		<p>
		Remember that at any time when using Langleo you can press
		the 'Menu' button and then 'Help' to get information about the screen
		you're currently in.

		<h2><a name="study">Study screen</a></h2>
		<p>
		This screen is definitely the most important one in the app. Here where
		the learning process takes place :)
		</p>
		<p>
		In the upper part of the screen you can see flags of both languages 
		(target language on top, base language under it). To the right of these
		there's a progress bar representing the progress of the current session, with
		the number of questions answered correctly and number of total questions in
		this session under it. You can also see the elapsed and estimated total time
		of the session.
		</p>
		<p>
		In the upper right corner is located the audio button. If activated
		the application will read both the question and answer at the appropriate
		time. When this button is activated you can also use gestures to indicate
		whether you knew the answer or not instead of the buttons. Moving your finger
		up on the touchscreen will have the same effect as the 'Correct' button.
		Moving it down will have the same effect as the 'Incorrect' button.
		This combination of audio and gestures lets you learn new words without
		even looking at the screen! It means you can do it with headphones on and
		your phone in your pocket.
		</p>
		<p>
		Please note that Langleo currently uses Text-To-Speech library
		to convert text to audio. Its current version is far from perfect, but
		the quality is going to improve in the next version of Android.
		It also doesn't read properly certain characters, especially the ones
		with accents above them.
		</p>
		<p>
		If you feel like learning more new words today than the current limit
		then you can increase it in 'Menu->More new words'.
		</p>
		<p>
		You can also quickly delete or edit the word you're seeing now by accessing
		these options after pressing 'Menu' button.
		</p>
		<h2><a name="collections">Collections screen</a></h2>
		<p>
		This screen lists all the collections you currently have. Each item
		in the list contains it's name, flags of languages, overall statistics and
		progress information. If a collection is disabled only it's name and flags
		of used languages are shown.
		</p>
		<p>To see contents of a collection simply click on it. To create a new collection press 'Menu->New'.
		Click and hold on a collection to edit or delete it.
		</p>
		<h2><a name="edit_collection">Edit collection screen</a></h2>
		<p>
		This screen lets you edit the selected collection. You can change it's name,
		base and target languages and priority. Priority controls the number of
		new words that will be taken from this collection, higher means more new words
		will come from this collection.
		</p>
		<p>
		You can also disable this collection. This means no new words will come
		from this collection.
		</p>
		<h2><a name="lists">Lists screen</a></h2>
		<p>
		This screen shows all lists in a given collection. You can add a new list
		by pressing 'Menu->New list'. You can also download lists from internet
		by clicking 'Menu->Download' or import them from text files ('Menu->Import').
		Exporting lets you save the words from selected lists in text
		files on your SD card.
		</p>
		<h2><a name="edit_list">Edit list screen</a></h2>
		<p>
		This just lets you change the name of the list.
		</p>
		<h2><a name="words">Words screen</a></h2>
		<p>
		Lists words in current list, the first line contains the word and the
		second its translation. Click on the word to edit it. 
		</p>
		<h2><a name="edit_word">Edit word screen</a></h2>
		<p>
		Here you can change the word, its translation and the note attached to it 
		(note is shown under the translation when studying). Clicking 'New' saves
		current word and creates a new one.
		</p>
		<h2><a name="select_file">File selection screen</a></h2>
		<p>
		This screen lets you select files which you want to import.
		Remember that each file will be loaded as a separate list and all
		selected files must use the same character as field separator.
		</p>
		<h2><a name="import">Import screen</a></h2>
		<p>
		</p>
		<h2><a name="export">Export screen</a></h2>
		<p>
		</p>
		<h2><a name="select_list">List selection screen</a></h2>
		<p>
		</p>
		<h2><a name="download">Download screen</a></h2>
		<p>
		This screen shows the available lists which can be downloaded for target
		language of current collection. The lists are downloaded directly from
		studystack.com so active internet connection is required. Click on the
		list you'd like to download to your collection.
		Use the search box on the top for quicker navigation.
		</p>
		<p>
		Langleo updates this list every few days, if for some reason you want
		to force an update then use 'Menu->Refresh'.
		</p>
		<h2><a name="list_details">List details screen</a></h2>
		<p>
		Here you can see the contents if the selected list before downloading it.
		Make sure that labels above columns match the languages in the actual content.
		If they don't then use the 'Switch word/translation order' box.
		</p>
