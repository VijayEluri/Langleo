		<h1>Text-To-Speech</h1>
		<p>
		Please note that Langleo currently uses Text-To-Speech library
		to convert text to audio. Its current version is far from perfect, but
		the quality is going to improve in the next version of Android.
		It also doesn't read properly certain characters, especially the ones
		with accents above them.
