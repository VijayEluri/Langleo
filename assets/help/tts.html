		<h1>Text-To-Speech</h1>
		<p>
		Langleo currently uses Text-To-Speech library
		to convert text to audio. What is important to understand is that
		two different engines can be used. The default engine supplied with
		Android 1.6 is called PicoTTS and provides high quality voice, but only
		for English, French, Spanish, Italian and German languages. The second
		engine, called eSpeakTTS, provides significantly lower quality voice, but
		for all languages supported by Langleo. So if you're using 
		English, French, Spanish, Italian or German then stick with PicoTTS,
		otherwise use eSpeakTTS.
		</p>
		<p>
		To use eSpeakTTS first you have to install 'Text-To-Speach Extended' from
		the market. After the installation 'TTS Service' should show up in your
		apps menu. There you can select the engine you want to use -
		'Default engine' (a download may start). After selecting the engine click
		'Listen to a preview' to make sure it works.
